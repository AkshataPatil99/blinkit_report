To improve Blinkit's performance based on the provided data, here are some actionable suggestions:
##
1. Expand High-Selling Categories: Given that fruits, snacks, and household items are the top-selling categories, consider expanding the variety within these categories and increasing stock to meet demand.

2. Promote Low-Selling Items: Items like seafood and breakfast products are low in sales. Promotional campaigns, discounts, or bundling these items with popular products could increase their visibility and sales.

3. Focus on High-Tier Locations: Since Tier 1 locations contribute the highest sales, consider opening more outlets in similar high-performing areas. Use data analytics to identify other potential high-tier locations.

4. Increase Average Rating: With an average rating of 3.9, there's room for improvement. Collect and analyze customer feedback to identify common issues and implement changes to enhance product quality and customer service.

5. Loyalty Programs: Introduce or enhance loyalty programs to retain existing customers and attract new ones. Offer exclusive deals, early access to new products, and personalized recommendations.
